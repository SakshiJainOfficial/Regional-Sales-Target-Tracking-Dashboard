# Regional Sales & Target Tracking Dashboard

## Overview

This dashboard tracks sales performance across different regions and evaluates how individual sales executives are performing against their targets. Itâ€™s built in Excel and includes automated calculations and visual summaries (likely powered by macros and formulas).

## File Contents

### 1. `DATA`

This is the raw data source and includes:

- `Emp Code`: Unique ID for each salesperson  
- `Sales Executive`: Name of the salesperson  
- `Region`: Their assigned sales region  
- `Day1` to `Day5`: Daily sales figures  
- `Total Sales`: Sum of daily sales  
- `Target`: Sales goal for the period  
- `Target Hit %`: Ratio of sales to target  
- `Away From Target %`: 1 minus the Target Hit %

> Update this sheet regularly as new sales data comes in.

### 2. `DASHBOARD`

A visual summary for quick review. It aggregates and ranks performance, highlights top performers, regional comparisons, and target progress.

> Data in this sheet is likely auto-generated. Avoid editing it manually unless you understand the structure.

## How to Use

1. **Update Data**: Go to the `DATA` sheet and update sales figures.
2. **Review Dashboard**: Switch to the `DASHBOARD` sheet to see updated summaries.
3. **Save as `.xlsm`**: Keep the macro-enabled format to retain all functionality.

## Notes

- Update targets directly in the `Target` column in the `DATA` sheet.
- To add a new employee, insert a new row in the `DATA` sheet with their info.
- Make sure formulas in `Total Sales`, `Target Hit %`, and `Away From Target %` are extended when adding rows.
